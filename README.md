# Overview

This project is an own implementation of the popular game _Asteroids_. There will two game-modes within the project, one where you have to fight enemies and
one where you have to destroy all asteroids.



# Run the Game

To run the game, open the following files and run these as a Java Application:  
* __Part 2__ - Play against enemy-ships: go to 'src' -> 'asteroids.part2' -> 'Part2.java' and run 'Part2.java' as a Java Application  
* __Part 3__ - Try to destroy all asteroids: go to 'src' -> 'asteroids.part3' -> 'Part3.java' and run 'Part3.java' as a Java Application  
Note that _Part 1_ is deprecated. This side-project was used to setup the game and later used for testing purposes. It is not possible to run _Part 1_ any
more due to a change in the game mechanics. _Part 2_ (and _Part 3_ correspondingly) extends _Part 1_ thus it was not possible to delete _Part 1_ and rename 
_Part 2_ and _3_ without rewrite quite some code (where I didn't found the effort for to do this).
